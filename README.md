# Movie Seat Booking System

We design an online Movie ticket booking system where a user can search a movie in a given city and book it. 

## Project Specifications
* Display UI with movie select, screen, seats, legend & seat info
* User can select a movie/price
* User can select/deselect seats
* User can not select occupied seats
* The number of seats and price will update
* Save seats, movie, and price to local storage so that UI is still populated on refresh


## Final Outcome:
